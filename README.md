# Annual Salary Predictor

This web application helps to predict annual salary based on certain factors such as:
- Age
- Education level
- Job Title
- Experience (in years)
- Gender

The users can play around and try different combinations using the super user-friendly widgets of Streamlit. Moreover we also provide a bit of EDA to show the data that has been used to train the underlying fairly simple model.
